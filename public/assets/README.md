# Assets Directory

This folder contains static assets for the resume application.

## Structure

- `/profile`: Contains the profile picture (e.g., `profile.jpg`).
- `/projects`: Contains project screenshots or covers (e.g., `project-1.jpg`).

You can replace these files with your own images. Ensure the filenames match what is defined in `src/data/projects.json` and `src/data/resume.json`.
