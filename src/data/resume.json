    "professional_summary":"Adaptable Software Engineer specialising in the design and delivery of robust, high-performance systems. I focus on architectural integrity, clean code, and operational reliability — building solutions that scale smoothly from development to production.

My experience spans full-stack development, backend services, database optimisation, and infrastructure automation. This allows me to approach problems holistically and deliver systems that are not only functional but maintainable, secure, and efficient.

I enjoy translating complex business requirements into practical technical solutions that improve performance, reduce operational costs, and support long-term growth.t: update kernel","core_skills": {
